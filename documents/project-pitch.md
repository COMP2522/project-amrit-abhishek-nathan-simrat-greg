## Project Overview
Our team's project will be a 2D adventure game, similar to the Legend of Zelda.
1. As a 2D video game, our project will make heavy use of Java FX library for the visuals.
2. We will need to constantly process game state and fetch information from the console.
3. In addition, we will need to store the position of objects in the game, so the player can load an previous session.
4. When the player picks up an object, it should delete itself from the data structure.
5. We will constantly check our requirements, test boundaries, and write Javadocs for every class.


## About Us
**Meetings**:

  * Greg Song - In charge of the client-server interactions and asynchronous processing.
  * Simrat Kaur - In charge of collision and item interactions.

**Expectations**:
  * Nathan Bartyuk - I want to learn a lot about visual and sound design, as well as creating an Object-Oriented game.
  * Abhishek Chouhan - I want to learn a lot of Java and improve at logic design.
  * Amrit Jhatu - I want to improve my Java skills and use it to create other projects after this is over.
