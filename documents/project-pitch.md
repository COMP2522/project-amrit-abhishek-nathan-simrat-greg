## Project Overview
Our team's project will be a 2D adventure-puzzle game, similar to Diamond Rush.
1. As a 2D video game, our project will make heavy use of Processing.orgs libraries for the visuals.
2. We will need to constantly process the game state and fetch information from the console.
3. Along with requirement 2, we will need to store the position of objects in the game, so if the player reaches a checkpoint, they can save their progress.
4. When the player breaks a breakable element, it delete itself from the data structure.
5. We will constantly check our requirements, test boundaries, and write javadocs for every method.


## About Us
**Meetings**: 
  * We will meet in-person every Monday to discuss our progress and what we need to get done.

**Communications**: 
  * We will use Discord to communicate with each other throughout the day.

**Roles**:
  * Nathan Bartyuk - In charge of visual design and sound.
  * Abhishek Chouhan - In charge of test coverage for every other role.
  * Amrit Singh - In charge of the backend coding and data implementation.
  * Greg Song - In charge of the high-level code structuring and organizing.
  * Simrat Kaur - In charge of asynchronous functions and collisidion detection.

**Expectations**:
  * Nathan Bartyuk - I want to learn a lot about visual and sound design, as well as creating an Object-Oriented game.
  * Abhishek Chouhan - I want to learn a lot of Java and improve at logic design.
  * Amrit Singh - I want to improve my Java skills and use it to create other projects after this is over.
  * Greg Song - I want to improve my diagram creation skills and OOP design.
  * Simrat Kaur - I want to learn more Java concepts and keep up my marks.

**Milestones**:
  1. Create the grid and playable character
  2. Fill the grid with different objects that interact with each other
  3. Fill the grid with hazards that the player must avoid
  4. Create a save system that keeps the player's progress
