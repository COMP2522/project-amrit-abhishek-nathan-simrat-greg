# Greg's Pitch

As the person in charge of the managing the saving and loading data, I will take ownership of SaveState, SaveStateHandler, Menu and if time permits Client and Server. 
My responsibility primarily includes planning and implementing the data structure to store data in json format and also being able to load this data to begin a previously saved game.

Since we will have to load save data to play a previously saved game, I will also focus on making a UI to start the game. This will be done by implementing a menu.
Then making sure that the game loads from this menu, and to implement a way to save more than one save state.
