As the person in charge of the visuals, I will take ownership of the Window and Map classes to make sure everything displays properly in the game. This includes writing the main method and fetching assets for the sprites and tiles. I will still have to be involved in the logical side of the project, of course, but I definitely have my work cut out for me.
