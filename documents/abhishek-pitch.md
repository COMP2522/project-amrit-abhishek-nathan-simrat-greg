# Abhishek's Pitch

As part of our project, I will be responsible for developing and maintaining the player/Entity class and the UI class. 
The player class will contain the movable avatar while the UI will manage all the different components 
and functionalities of our project.

I am committed to ensuring that these sections are cohesive and functional by the end of our project. 
I will work closely with my team members to ensure that we are all on the same page and 
to provide support whenever anyone encounters any obstacles or difficulties.
In addition, I am open to feedback and suggestions from my team members as we work together to create a successful project. 
I am confident that our collaboration will result in a high-quality final product that we can all be proud of.
