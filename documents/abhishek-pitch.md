# Abhishek's Pitch

I am going to be handling the player class and the sprite manager class.

The player class contains the movable avatar and the sprite manager manages all the functionality of the different components across the project.
I take responsiblity for these classes and will ensure these sections are cohesive and working by the end of our project.
Apart from these sections, I still intend to work closely with my team and help each other out in cases when we get stuck and can't figure things out ourselves.
