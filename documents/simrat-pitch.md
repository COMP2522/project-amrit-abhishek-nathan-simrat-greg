As a member of the team, I will be responsible for managing the Tile abstract class that extends Background, 
Wall, and Checkpoint classes. Additionally, I will be handling the implementation of the collidable interface.
My primary focus will be on developing the necessary functionality for these classes, with the expectation that
these sections will be completed by the end of the semester.

Throughout the development process, I plan to conduct extensive testing to ensure the functionality of these classes 
meets the project's requirements. Additionally, I will collaborate with my group members to share knowledge and offer 
support when needed. I will also be available to assist my group members in overcoming challenges and to contribute 
whenever my help would be required.

Overall, my aim is to deliver high-quality, professional work that meets the project's objectives while upholding 
the values of our team.
