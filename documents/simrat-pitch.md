As a member of the team, my responsibilities include managing the Element class, which is the super class for Fire,
Ruby, PowerUp, and Door elements in the game. I will also be responsible for implementing the CollisionDetector 
class specifically for the parts where the player collides with the elements.
My primary focus will be on developing the necessary functionality for these classes, with the expectation that
these sections will be completed by the end of the semester.

Throughout the development process, I plan to conduct extensive testing to ensure the functionality of these classes 
meets the project's requirements. Additionally, I will collaborate with my group members to share knowledge and offer 
support when needed. I will also be available to assist my group members in overcoming challenges and to contribute 
whenever my help would be required.

Overall, my aim is to deliver high-quality, professional work that meets the project's objectives while upholding 
the values of our team.
