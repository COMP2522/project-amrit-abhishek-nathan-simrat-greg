# Amrit's Pitch

I will handle non player interactions for the most part, and a bit of work here and there which would involve collision detection and movement. I am also in charge of writing test cases for these non player entities, though only up until everything checks out. 


Past the pitch, I have to say that starting the project up was one of the most difficult parts when you are just trying to figure out what to put on code and waiting for a part here or there. I feel there is a lot I would have done different, and hopefully I can carry some of these lessons to the projects term. 

I learned a lot about GitHub that I was unaware of before, and it has a lot of great tools for organization and actually allowing others to work on branches that do not interfere with the main. I need to work on pushing smaller bits of code faster, and having my issues be steps rather than whole chunks of code. There were times where my branch would become quite outdated because I had spent so long on it and the main branch had warped so much.
