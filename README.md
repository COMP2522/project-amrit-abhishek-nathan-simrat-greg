# Project Ruby

# Project Pitch


# Instructions
1. Run Main.java
2. Follow the Menu interface, setting a username that will be used to get your saved game.
3. Collect Rubies and don't get hit by monsters by using the WASD keys.


# Requirements
**Requirement 1:** We used Java Graphics to draw all of our user interfaces, which has similar methods to Processing.org. Then it will be drawn in a JPanel.

**Requirement 2:** We used asynchronous processing to save the game each time each time the player encounters a ruby.

**Requirement 3:** The gamestate is stored as a JSON file, containing two key value pairs of gamePanelData and playerData. The value for gamePanelData is another JSONObject consisting of 3 arrays. 

**Requirement 4:** 

**Requirement 5:** We have added javadoc, comments and provided a UML diagram.
